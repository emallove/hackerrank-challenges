# python3 program for power set

# 
# 
# Given an array of integers, find the subset of non-adjacent elements with the
# maximum sum. Calculate the sum of that subset. It is possible that the maximum
# sum is , the case when all elements are negative.
# 
# Example
# 
# The following subsets with more than  element exist. These exclude the empty
# subset and single element subsets which are also valid.
# 
# Subset      Sum
# [-2, 3, 5]   6
# [-2, 3]      1
# [-2, -4]    -6
# [-2, 5]      3
# [1, -4]     -3
# [1, 5]       6
# [3, 5]       8 The maximum subset sum is . Note that any individual element is
# a subset as well.
# 
# 
# In this case, it is best to choose no element: return .
#
