# You can perform the following operations on the string, :
# 
# Capitalize zero or more of 's lowercase letters.  Delete all of the remaining
# lowercase letters in .  Given two strings,  and , determine if it's possible
# to make  equal to  as described. If so, print YES on a new line. Otherwise,
# print NO.
# 
# For example, given  and , in  we can convert  and delete  to match . If  and ,
# matching is not possible because letters may only be capitalized or discarded,
# not changed.
# 
# Function Description
# 
# Complete the function  in the editor below. It must return either  or .
# 
# abbreviation has the following parameter(s):
# 
# a: the string to modify b: the string to match Input Format
# 
# The first line contains a single integer , the number of queries.
# 
# Each of the next  pairs of lines is as follows: - The first line of each query
# contains a single string, .  - The second line of each query contains a single
# string, .
# 
# Constraints
# 
# String  consists only of uppercase and lowercase English letters,
# ascii[A-Za-z].  String  consists only of uppercase English letters,
# ascii[A-Z].  Output Format
# 
# For each query, print YES on a new line if it's possible to make string  equal
# to string . Otherwise, print NO.
# 
# Sample Input
# 
# 1 daBcd ABC Sample Output
# 
# YES Explanation
# 
# image
# 
# We have  daBcd and  ABC. We perform the following operation:
# 
# Capitalize the letters a and c in  so that  dABCd.  Delete all the remaining
# lowercase letters in  so that  ABC.  Because we were able to successfully
# convert  to , we print YES on a new line.
